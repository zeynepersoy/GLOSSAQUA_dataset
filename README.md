# GLOSSAQUA_dataset

This is the GitHub repository of "GLOSSAQUA: a GLObal dataset of Size Spectra across AQUAtic ecosystems" presented in Ersoy et al. 2025.

The dataset was financially supported by the [Iberian Society of Ecology](https://www.sibecol.org/en/) Advanced Early Career Researchers Project Grant (ACROSS project).

Dataset last updated: 13.12.2024

## Repository structure

To download and explore the dataset, download or clone the repository. Then, open `GLOSSAQUA_dataset.Rproj` Project file to start a fresh RStudio, with the working directory and file browser pointed at the project folder.

If you want to use any other environment other than RStudio, please make sure to change your working directory to the location fo this folder.

The repository uses different packages (e.g., `here`,`dplyr`, `maps`, `scico`, `ggplot2`, `cowplot`, `forcats`, `gghalves`, `ghibli`) that can all be installed from CRAN using the `install.packages(‚Äúpackage name‚Äù)` code syntax.

More details on how to [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) this repository can be find in the linked websites.

This repository holds folders called "data" and "figures" presented in Ersoy et al. 2024 and the R code used to reproduce them and is structured as follows:

üìÅ data/: contain  tab-delimited TXT files that should never be modified.  .    
üìÅ rscripts/: store R scripts to reproduce figures and standardize size spectrum slopes.


In the üìÅ data/, you can find the following TXT files:

`GLOSSAQUA_Dictionary.txt`  integrates the description of all variables present in the other TXT files. Each row corresponds to a variable while the columns contain the name of the variable and its description, an example, and the name of the TXT files where this variable can be found

`GLOSSAQUA_DataSource.txt` represents the article and datasets used to collect size spectrum parameters. Each row corresponds to a study while the columns contain the article identification, the abbreviated citation, the peer-reviewed journal, the year of publication and the Digital Object Identifier (DOI).

`GLOSSAQUA_Sample.txt` contains the information of each sample with its projected geographical coordinates in WGS84 (latitude and longitude). Each row corresponds to the sample while columns include the biogeographic realms, the type of ecosystem type, the environmental context, the level of ecological complexity, the organismal group and the sampling method.

`GLOSSAQUA_Size.txt` compiles information related to the size spectrum methodology and parameters. Each row corresponds to the individual estimates of size spectrum parameters, while the columns include the size spectrum parameters (i.e., slope, intercept and linearity), body size units, and body size ranges.

In the üìÅ rscripts/, you can find the following R codes:

`Figures_GLOSSAQUA_dataset.R`: This script loads the data files from data folder and merge them to reproduce the figures in the manuscript.

`Standardization_GLOSSAQUA_dataset.R`: This scripts transforms the theoretical values of the size spectrum slopes based on [Sprules and Barth 2016](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0115) and [Guiet et al. 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304380016301958).


## Data structure

GLOSSAQUA compiles a comprehensive collection of size spectrum parameters (i.e. slope, intercept and linearity) across aquatic ecosystems and trophic levels. Data were acquired from two different sources: a classic literature review and an online survey.

To be included in the GLOSSAQUA dataset, all studies had to meet the following criteria: (1) to be field-based studies and hence, experimental (including in situ experiments) or theoretical studies were excluded; (2) to involve animal communities and hence, primary producers were excluded unless they were included as part of a food web (e.g., phytoplankton-zooplankton-fish); and (3) to be studies based on individual body size measurements without relying on mean or maximum body size per species.

For studies derived from the literature review, we extracted size spectrum parameters (e.g., slope, intercept and linearity) directly from tables or by digitizing information from plots using WebPlotDigitizer software v.3.4 (Rohatgi 2020). For studies derived from the online survey (i.e., individual body size datasets), we calculated size spectrum parameters following the fitting recommendation provided by [Sprules (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128191668000244?via%3Dihub). We highly recommend potential users of the GLOSSAQUA dataset look at [Edwards et al. 2019](https://github.com/andrew-edwards/sizeSpectra) to familiarize themselves with the different methods used to calculate the size spectrum.

For all studies, we also extracted additional information related to geographic location, ecosystem type, taxonomic groups, sampling method and period (mainly month), size spectrum method, number of size classes and minimum and maximum size classes.
